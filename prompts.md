## Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Applied Methodology

#### 1. Architecture First, Code Second
Principle: Architectural decisions must be made with deep understanding of the domain.

**Initial Prompt - Distributed System Architecture**
```
You are a senior software architect specialized in distributed systems.

CONTEXT:
Inventory management system for retail chain with 50+ stores.
Current problem: batch synchronization every 15min causes inconsistencies.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Latency < 1 second for inventory updates
2. Eventual consistency acceptable (CAP theorem - AP preferred)
3. Complete audit trail of all operations
4. Support 10,000 transactions/second
5. Network failure and partition tolerance

CONSTRAINTS:
- Stack: Java 17, Spring Boot 3.x
- Deploy: Containers (K8s ready)
- Budget: Cost-effective solution

TASK:
Propose distributed architecture using:
- Event-Driven Architecture
- CQRS pattern
- Event Sourcing for audit trail
- Distributed cache (Redis)
- Idempotency in operations

DELIVERABLE:
1. Component diagram (textual description)
2. Justification for each architectural decision
3. Identified trade-offs
4. Consistency strategy
5. Resilience plan
```

**Result:** Event-driven architecture with read/write separation, L1/L2 cache, and event log for replay.

---

#### 2. RESTful API Design

**Prompt - Endpoint Specification**
```
As a Tech Lead, I need a REST API for distributed inventory management.

CONTEXT:
- Multi-store system with shared inventory
- Operations: sale (decrement), restock (increment), manual adjustment
- Need for batch operations for initial synchronization

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Query current inventory (GET)
2. Process sale (POST) - atomic decrement
3. Process restock (POST) - atomic increment
4. Batch synchronization (POST) - multiple stores
5. Query event history (GET)

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Validation with Bean Validation (JSR-303)
- Idempotency via eventId
- API versioning (v1)
- OpenAPI 3.0 documentation
- Standardized error handling (RFC 7807)
- Rate limiting awareness

TASK:
1. Define API contracts (request/response DTOs)
2. Specify validations
3. Design error responses
4. Add OpenAPI annotations
5. Consider backward compatibility

FORMAT:
Java code with Spring Boot annotations
```

**Result:** `InventoryController.java` with documented endpoints and validated DTOs.

---

#### 3. Resilience Implementation

**Prompt - Retry Pattern and Circuit Breaker**
```
Implement resilience in distributed inventory operations.

SCENARIO:
- Operations may fail due to contention (OptimisticLockException)
- External calls (notifications, sync) may timeout
- System must degrade gracefully

REQUIRED IMPLEMENTATION:

1. RETRY PATTERN:
   - 3 attempts with exponential backoff
   - Initial backoff: 1s, multiplier: 2x
   - Retry only on OptimisticLockException
   - Log each attempt

2. CIRCUIT BREAKER:
   - Threshold: 50% failures in 10 requests
   - Timeout: 5 seconds
   - Half-open after 30s

3. TIMEOUT:
   - Synchronous operations: 3s max
   - Batch operations: 30s max

STACK:
- Spring Retry (@Retryable)
- Resilience4j (CircuitBreaker)
- Micrometer for metrics

TASK:
Generate Java code with:
- Configured annotations
- Appropriate exception handling
- Structured logging
- Observability metrics
```

**Result:** `InventoryService.java` with @Retryable, fallback methods, and circuit breaker.

---

#### 4. Event Sourcing Implementation

**Prompt - Complete Audit System**
```
Implement Event Sourcing for complete inventory operation traceability.

DOMAIN:
- Every inventory change must be recorded as immutable event
- Events: SALE, RESTOCK, ADJUSTMENT, BATCH_SYNC
- Support event replay for debugging and reconciliation

REQUIREMENTS:

1. EVENT STORE:
   - Append-only events table
   - Fields: eventId (UUID), type, product, quantity, before, after, timestamp
   - Status: PENDING -> PROCESSED | FAILED | COMPENSATED

2. IDEMPOTENCY:
   - Operations with same eventId must be idempotent
   - Duplication check before processing

3. AUDIT TRAIL:
   - Who executed (userId, storeId)
   - When (UTC timestamp)
   - What changed (before/after snapshot)
   - Why (reason/description)

4. EVENT REPLAY:
   - Ability to reconstruct state from events
   - Temporal queries: "what was inventory on 2025-10-15?"

STACK:
- Spring Data JPA
- Entity: InventoryEvent
- Repository with query methods

TASK:
Generate JPA entities, repository, and service for complete event sourcing.
```

**Result:** `InventoryEvent.java`, `InventoryEventRepository.java` with custom queries.

## Practical Usage Examples

### Case 1: JPA Query Optimization

**Problem:** N+1 queries in product search with inventory

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Optimize this JPA query causing N+1 problem:

@Query("SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.quantity > 0")
List<Product> findAvailableProducts();

Context: Product has @OneToMany relationship with InventoryEvent.
Need to load recent events (last 10) along with product.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Resolve N+1 with fetch join
- Limit events to 10 most recent
- Use pagination (max 100 products)
- Performant query for 10k+ products

Return optimized query with @Query annotation.
```

**Result:**
```java
@Query("SELECT DISTINCT p FROM Product p " +
       "LEFT JOIN FETCH p.events e " +
       "WHERE p.quantity > 0 AND e.createdAt >= :since " +
       "ORDER BY p.id, e.createdAt DESC")
Page<Product> findAvailableProductsWithRecentEvents(
    @Param("since") LocalDateTime since, 
    Pageable pageable
);
```

---

### Case 2: Complex DTO Validation

**Prompt for Copilot:**
```
Create DTO for batch sale operation with validations:

Business rules:
- Product mandatory (productId not null)
- Quantity: min 1, max 1000 per operation
- StoreId mandatory (UUID format)
- EventId mandatory (idempotency)
- Timestamp optional (default now)

Use Bean Validation annotations and OpenAPI docs.
```

**Generated + Adjusted Result:**
```java
@Schema(description = "Batch sale request")
public record BatchSaleRequest(
    
    @NotNull(message = "Product ID is required")
    @Schema(description = "Product ID", example = "123")
    Long productId,
    
    @Min(value = 1, message = "Minimum quantity is 1")
    @Max(value = 1000, message = "Maximum quantity is 1000")
    @Schema(description = "Quantity sold", example = "10")
    Integer quantity,
    
    @NotNull(message = "Store ID is required")
    @Pattern(regexp = "^[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}$")
    @Schema(description = "Store ID (UUID)", example = "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")
    String storeId,
    
    @NotNull(message = "Event ID is required for idempotency")
    @Schema(description = "Unique event ID", example = "evt_1234567890")
    String eventId,
    
    @Schema(description = "Operation timestamp (UTC)", example = "2025-10-29T02:55:07Z")
    LocalDateTime timestamp
) {
    // Custom validation: timestamp cannot be in the future
    public BatchSaleRequest {
        if (timestamp != null && timestamp.isAfter(LocalDateTime.now())) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Timestamp cannot be in the future");
        }
        if (timestamp == null) {
            timestamp = LocalDateTime.now();
        }
    }
}
```

### Case 3: Technical Decision Documentation

**Prompt for Claude:**
```
Document architectural decision about choosing eventual consistency vs strong consistency.

CONTEXT:
Distributed inventory system, CAP theorem applied.

DECISION:
We chose AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance) over CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance).

REQUIRED JUSTIFICATION:
1. Why is eventual consistency acceptable?
2. What risks does this bring?
3. How do we mitigate overselling?
4. Business vs technical trade-offs
5. Alternatives considered

FORMAT: Technical markdown for README.md
```

**Result:** "Architectural Decisions" section in README.md

## Learnings and Best Practices

### What Worked Well

1. **Rich Context in Prompts**
    - Always include: business domain, technical constraints, expected example
    - Result: Code more adherent to requirements

2. **Incremental Iteration**
    - Start with architecture -> API design -> implementation -> tests
    - Avoids massive rework

3. **Critical Review of Generated Code**
    - AI generates functional code, but not always optimized
    - Example: Generated code used `List` where `Set` was more appropriate

4. **Use of Prompt Templates**
    - Claude Prompt Library accelerated creation of structured prompts

### Avoided Pitfalls

1. **Blind Trust in Generated Code**
    - BAD: Not validating business rules
    - GOOD: Always test edge cases manually

2. **Vague Prompts**
    - BAD: "Create an inventory system"
    - GOOD: "Create distributed inventory system with CQRS, event sourcing, supporting 10k TPS, eventual consistency, idempotency via eventId"

3. **Lack of Technical Context**
    - BAD: Not mentioning stack (Spring Boot version, Java version)
    - GOOD: Specifying exact versions avoids deprecated code

4. **Overengineering**
    - BAD: Implementing everything AI suggests
    - GOOD: Filter suggestions based on YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
